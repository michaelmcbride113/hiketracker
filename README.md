# Sopranos Hangman
I chose to do hangman as my game and chose the TV show *The Sopranos* as the theme. *The Sopranos* is my favorite TV show with so many memorable quotes and characters that it seemed like a no brainer as the theme.

## Getting started
You can find the [deployed game here](https://michaelmcbride113.github.io/Sopranos-hangman-game/)

My planning materials [can be found here](https://github.com/michaelmcbride113/Sopranos-hangman-game/blob/main/js/psuedocode.js)


## Attributions
### Hangman images
 - I was having trouble finding sequential updated hangman images for my game. I ended up finding a [Javascript hangman game](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/build-a-hangman-game-using-javascript/?utm_source=auth&utm_medium=saved&utm_campaign=articles) through Google and used their images for my game.
 ### MDN
-  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I used MDN when I was unable to come up with/find code that's applicable in my lecture notes or lab work. For example, I could not figure out how to update my hangman images with an incorrect guess so I used the [innerHTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) which I found on MDN.

## Technologies Used: 
1. **HTML**
    * HTML was used to write all the text on the website
    * HTML was incredibly helpful when creating the site as it is the backbone of my whole project
2. **CSS**
    * CSS was used for styling the site
    * Before implementing the CSS, my game was working but it was incredibly ugly to look at and did not provide a good user experience
3. **Javascript**
    * Javascript is where I spent the vast majority of my time working on the website
    * Javascript houses all the background code that makes my site function the way it does and makes my game playable.
4. **data.js**
    * I used a data.js file to house the answers for my game. The data.js file allowed me to keep data seperate from my Javascript file and keep my workspace cleaner and more organized.


## Next steps
There were quite a few things I wanted to include in my site but I was unable to due to time limitations and my current skill level 

1. **Add in locations and quotes as options for answers**
* Currently my game only uses names as the words users are guessing. In the future I'd like to include locations from the show and famous quotes for some variety

2. **Update images with images I make myself**
* Originally I had planned on making the hangman images I used in the game. My plan was to find gallows online and use a cut up image of Tony Soprano but I was not able to create the images in time. 
3. **Update website to mirror website from the show**
* In Season 1 of *The Sopranos*, Tony's kids find a mafia website which lists their father as a famous mobster. The website is incredibly dated now obviously but I thought it'd be fun to recreate the site for my game. This is something I definitely want to do in the future as fans of the show would love this detail.
